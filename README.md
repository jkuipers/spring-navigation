Spring navigation
=================

Spring navigation is a simple Spring MVC plugin that helps with logical navigation. It can be used for multi-paged
websites. It allows to denote some pages as base navigation points, and others as step navigation points. While browsing
through the site, the user builds up a server-side navigational state on the session, which can be used for e.g. a back
button or dynamic redirects.
